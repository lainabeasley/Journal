# Basic Coding Journal
Many of the best engineers that I have worked with professionally have kept some sort of engineering journal. I personally packed notebooks around with me for nearly 8 years before I began keeping my notes electronically. Your journal can track ideas, bugs, cool links, code snippets, shell commands, rants, or simply a reflection on what worked well or not-so-well with a lab activity.  

## Getting Started
Please click the ***Use this template*** link to create your own private coding journal.  
Once created, you can use the GitHub web interface to maintain your journal or clone it down to your development environment and use an IDE such as VSCode.  

## Markdown Resources
Markdown is a notation that is used to format text documents.  It is widely used in Software Development shops around the world, which is why we're asking you to use it in your lab documentation.  

Github provides a guide for getting started:  [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
